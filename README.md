ðŸ“Š Sales & Profit Dashboard Report


Company: UpNorth Analytics


Period Covered: 2021 â€“ 2024


Executive Summary
Over the past four years UpNorth Analytics has generated just under $2 million in sales with a total profit of about $248,000. The dashboard shows that sales have steadily increased year-on-year, but profit has not grown at the same pace. This points to strong demand for our products but also to areas where costs or pricing may need attention.



What the Dashboard Shows


Yearly Performance:
Sales have climbed consistently from 2021 through 2024. Profit, however, has been fairly flat despite higher revenue. This suggests that our margins are being squeezed and we should review pricing and costs.
Product Categories

Technology, Furniture and Office Supplies bring in the most revenue. Within these, products such as phones, chairs and storage drive the highest profits. On the other hand, low-value items like supplies, art and envelopes contribute very little to the bottom line.

Customers
A handful of customers â€“ notably Martinez, Adrian Barton and Sanjit Chand â€“ generate a large share of our profit. Keeping these relationships strong should be a priority. At the same time, there is room to identify new customers who resemble our top performers.

Regions
Sales vary widely by state. Some locations are producing very small amounts compared to others. These areas could be targeted for expansion or marketing to unlock growth.
Seasonality
Sales tend to peak in certain months, especially in the second and fourth quarters. This is valuable for planning promotions and inventory.




Decision Points
â€¢	Retain and grow key customers â€“ focus on service and tailored offers for our top five clients.
â€¢	Rebalance the product mix â€“ emphasise high-margin products and review pricing or sourcing for low-margin ones.
â€¢	Expand in underperforming states â€“ direct marketing and sales efforts to regions with low current sales.
â€¢	Plan for seasonal peaks â€“ align stock, staffing and campaigns with the months that traditionally see higher sales.



Recommendations

Area	Action

Sales Growth	Run targeted campaigns in weaker states and offer bundles during high-season months.
Customer Retention	Launch a simple loyalty or VIP programme for our highest-value customers.

Product Profitability	Reduce focus on low-margin items or negotiate better supplier terms.
